SCALER ANALYSIS
****************

This directory contains code to analyze the scaler tree,
and properly calcuate the live time, bcm_charge, and tracking efficiencies
by putting BCM current cuts, and counting scaler reads only if they passed the
cut.

For now,  the code will be used to test the D2 experiment elastic runs
3288, 3371, 3374, and 3377
