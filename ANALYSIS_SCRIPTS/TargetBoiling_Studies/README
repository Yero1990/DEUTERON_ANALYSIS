Target Boiling Studies

May 06, 2019

The target boiling studies consist of determining the number of events that
were lost due to local target boiling. The procedure is as follows:

Determined the Normalized Yields vs. Beam Current for Carbon, LH2, LD2.

 * Carbon target does NOT boil, so the expected Normalized yield should
   NOT change with beam current. This will establish a reference point to 
   which compare the LH2/LD2 liquid targets.

 * For LH2/LD2, there is a negative slope expected, indicating lower normalized
   yields with increasing beam current.  

 * The difference between Carbon and LH2 (or LD2) indicated the the fraction
   of yield lost due to boiling. 

 * This is then added as a correction to the data yield used to calculate a
   cross section.
