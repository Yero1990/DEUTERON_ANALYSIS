********************
   Q2 Cut Study
********************

The SHMS/SHMS reco. quantities DATA/SIMC were compared for three different
regions in Q2.

===Settings===
1) Q2: (3.6, 3.8)

2) Q2: (3.8, 4.3)

3) Q2: (4.3, 4.6)

**It was found that at the edges of Q2 (settings 1 and 3), there were some
disagreements, related to the HMS Collimator in the data being cut before
the HMS collimator in SIMC.
 
To investigate further, need to put additional cut on HMS xptar variable
in the region where DATA/SIMC disagree.

1) Q2: (4.3, 4.6), HMS Xptar:  < -0.04

** If you could plot xfp versus yfp  and project to the dipole exit ( xfp-147*xpfp versus yfp -147ypfp) 
   for these events with the xptar < -.04 and for the events with xptar > -.04 for SIMC and data. Maybe we iwll
   get lucky and see something at the dipole exit.
