D(e,e'p)n Cross Sections
*************************

June 16, 2019;

The directories: pm80/, pm580/ and pm750/  contain the
ROOTfiles with the 2D Pm vs. theta_nq histograms obtained from
the main analysis code, analyze.C

average_Xsec/plotXsec.C : C++ code that gets the theta_nq projections of the
2D histos and plots the 1D cross sections for various theta_nq bins.

average_Xsec/plotXsec.py : python code (original from avg kin.) that read the ROOTfiles
with the 2D Pm vs. theta_nq and write to file the bin information
containing the cross sections for data, PWIA and FSI for each (Pm, thnq) bin


The theory cross sections obtained from SIMC are from Laget, and represent
average cross sections, since the input kinematics in SIMC are the central
kinematics at the vertex, NOT the averaged kinematics.

----------------------

The averaged kinematics I had sent Werner, he used as input in the theory,
external to SIMC to get the cross sections at the averaged kinematics.
These represent the cross sections at the true kinematics.  These
cross sections will be used to calculate the bin centering corrections as
follows:

dataSig_corr = dataSig * ( theorySig / theorySig_avg )

where theorySig: theory cross sections at the average kinematics
and theorySig_avg are the avg. theory cross sections at the central kinematics.

-----------------------

The order in directories to get the momentum distributions are:

1. average_kinematics
In this directory, 'calc_avg_kin.py' code read the 2D avg. kin histos from the
ROOTfiles, and calculates additional kinematics using the avg. kinematics. In addition,
the deForest cross section k*sig_cc1 is calculated externally, using the avg. kinematics and is to
be used later on to determine the momentum distributions.  A .txt file
is generated containing the average kinematics values and the corresponding bin information.
(It is important to have the same binning scheme for the 80, 580, 750 MeV setting for Pm and th_nq, 
as these form the 2D histos, and they must be consistent. So for example, bin22 in one setting must be the same 
bin22 in the other)  In order to actually do this, however, it is best to create various same size arrays
for each kin. setting, and store the cross sections in these arrays, for each given bin, one would store
the 80, 580 and 750 MeV setting momentum distribution. If they happen to overlap, then one would take the 
weighted average of the overlapping bins. 

2. average_Xsec
In this directory, the 2D_Pm_vs_thnq_Xsec are extracted from the 2D Histograms for both data and SIMC. These are
referred to as the average cross sections.

3. theory_Xsec
In this directory, the model cross sections are calculated at the average kinematics. So the .txt files containing
the average kinematics in <average_kinematics> directory are read as input, and the Laget_Xsec code is used (external to SIMC)
to calculate the model cross sections. 

4. bin_centering_corrections
In this directory, the average and model cross sections from directories in (2) and (3) are used to do the bin centering
corrections as follows:  dataXsec_bc_corr = dataXsec_bc_uncorr * (theory_Xsec / theory_avg_Xsec)
The data before and after bin centering corrections, and the model cross sections (evaluated at the avg. kin), and the
reduced cross sections for both data and theory  are then written to a file.

5. combine_data
In this directory, the data from the various data sets and kin. settings are combined.  To be done: the momentum distribution data
must be written to arrays of same size for each setting, then one can loop over each bin, combine any existing data in the
overlapping bins and add to a new combined txt file that will be used for plotting.
