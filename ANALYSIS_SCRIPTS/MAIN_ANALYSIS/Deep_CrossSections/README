D(e,e'p)n Cross Sections
*************************

June 16, 2019;

The directories: pm80/, pm580/ and pm750/  contain the
ROOTfiles with the 2D Pm vs. theta_nq histograms obtained from
the main analysis code, analyze.C

ploXsec.C : C++ code that gets the theta_nq projections of the
2D histos and plots the 1D cross sections for various theta_nq bins.

plotXsec.py : python code (original from avg kin.) that read the ROOTfiles
with the 2D Pm vs. theta_nq and write to file the bin information
containing the cross sections for data, PWIA and FSI for each (Pm, thnq) bin


The theory cross sections obtained from SIMC are from Laget, and represent
average cross sections, since the input kinematics in SIMC are the central
kinematics at the vertex, NOT the averaged kinematics.

----------------------

The averaged kinematics I had sent Werner, he used as input in the theory,
external to SIMC to get the cross sections at the averaged kinematics.
These represent the cross sections at the true kinematics.  These
cross sections will be used to calculate the bin centering corrections as
follows:

dataSig_corr = dataSig * ( theorySig / theorySig_avg )

where theorySig: theory cross sections at the average kinematics
and theorySig_avg are the theory cross sections at the central kinematics.
