Bin-Centering Corrections
**************************

June 17, 2019

To do bin-centering corrections, an average theoretical cross section as
well as the cross section at the average kinemtics are needed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Averaged Theoretical Cross Section:

code:  ../../average_Xsec/calc_Xsec.py

description: read the 2D average Cross Sections from DATA and Theory, and
	     extracts the cross section in (Pm, theta_nq) bins

The average theoretical cross section is calculated from central kinematics.
By using the vertex kinemtaics from the simulation program (SIMC) as input
in the Lage_Xsec_fp_1.f code.  This code has already been adapted to work
as a module in SIMC. The average cross sections are therefore calculated from
the ( SIMC Yield / Phase Space ) using the Laget model.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theoretical Cross Section at the Average:

code: calc_cross.py (uses Laget subroutine to extract cross section)
      Laget_Xsec_fp_1.f (Theory calculation code )
      
      For Misak and CD-Bonn theory,  Werner has the codes for those. 

avg.kin_files: ../../average_kinematics/pm{80,580,750}_{pwia, fsi}_norad_avgkin_set{1,2,3}.txt

The theoretical cross sections at the "average kinematics" is calculated.
For this, the average kinematics in (Pm, theta_nq) bins are needed first.
The averaged kinematics in Pm vs. theta_nq bins has been calculated (from
SIMC only) in the analyze.C code ( see ../../../analyze.C )

The average kinematics .txt files are used as input in the calc_theory_Xsec.py code to extract the
Laget Cross Sections.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

By taking the ratio of: (Xsec @ avg. kin.)  / (avg. Xsec @ central kin.) one is able 
to correct the data cross section from the bin center to an averaged over that bin.

Data_Xsec_corr = Data_Xsec_UnCorr * (theory Xsec @ avg. kin.)  / (avg. theory Xsec @ central kin.)
