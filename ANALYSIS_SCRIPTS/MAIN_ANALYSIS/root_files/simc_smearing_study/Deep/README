D(e,e'p)n Smearing Studies
***************************

The smearing studies on D(e,e'p)n consists on smearing delta, x'tar, y'tar
in order to observe the effect on Pmiss data/simc comparison, as the 
ratio currently appears to be 20-30 % off unity at Pmiss > 100 MeV.
It is suspected that SIMC has slightly smaller resolution.

delta_smearing:
The delta in HMS/SHMS was changed from 0.04 to 0.075.  The Pmiss did not
change, but Emiss showed smearing, which we do not want. Leave delta smearing
at 0.04

x'tar smearing:
delta_smearing was left at 0.04
The X'tar was changed from 1 to 2 mr. No significant change was observed in
Pmiss. 

y'tar smearing:
With delta at 0.04 and x'tar at 2 mr, y'tar smearing was set to
* 1mr: 

It seems the Y'tar smearing causes a shift in SIMC Pmiss. 

I will only apply a large X'tar smearing to understand the effect.
