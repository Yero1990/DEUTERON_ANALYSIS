 Missing Energy Study
**********************

Brief: This study consist of studying the W integrated yield ratio Ydata/Ysimc
for SIMC HMS Collimator Configurations:

HMS Coll. Eloss ON
HMS Coll. Eloss OFF


For each of these configurations, the Missing energy cut on both data and
simc will be varied from 0.03 (30 MeV) to 0.08 (80 MeV) 

**With no energy loss in the collimator, it is expected that the
  ratio varies significantly, as the missing energy cut on will cut
  out events in data underneath the W peak, whereas in SIMC, no events
  will be cut in the main W peak

**With energy loss in the collimator turned on, it is expected that
  the ratio is independent of the cut, as the cut should affect both
  data and simc equally. This is because now simc has events at large
  missing energy that correspong to W events at ~ proton mass, indicating 
  that the protons lost energy in the collimator, but it was still a (e,e'p)
  so the W reconstructs to the proton mass.

The basic cuts applied were:
HMS delta:  -8, 8
SHMS delta: -10, 22
W:           0.85, 1.05
