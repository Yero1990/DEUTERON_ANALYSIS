FOCAL PLANE STUDIES
*******************

To understand if the focal plane has a significant impact on the missing 
momentum, cuts are made on SHMS focal plane regions where the data/simc
agree. 

The Ratio of Pmiss is studied with and without the focal plane cuts;

The general cuts made were:
Emiss < 40 MeV
HMS Delta: (-8,8) %
SHMS Delta: (-10, 22) %
HMS Collimator Cut:
*smearinfg only on delta: 0.04 (default smearing)
