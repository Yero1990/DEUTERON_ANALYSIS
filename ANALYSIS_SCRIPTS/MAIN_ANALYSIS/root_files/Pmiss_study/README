******************
Pmiss Cuts Study
*****************

Examine the Missing Momentum Ratio Pm_data / Pm_simc and SIMC/DATA comparison, with and without missing momentum components cuts.

The general cuts placed are:
Em < 40 MeV
HMS Delta: (-8,8) %
SHMS Delta: (-10,22) %
HMS Collimator Cut: Scale 1

Smearing: 
HMS Delta = 0.04
SHMS Delta = 0.04

-----------------------------------
From the meeting with Werner, there might be
background from data, so I must have a coincidence time cut.

Additionally, It looks like the largest effect in the Pm yield ratio
is after making the Ztar_difference cut. Which looks like is mostly coming
from tails in data (hence there might be large noise and coin cut is required)
