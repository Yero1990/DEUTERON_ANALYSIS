HMS Collimator Study
*********************

The ratio of DATA / SIMC Yield (Integral of Inv. Mass, W) is
plotted as a function of SHMS 3/4 rates for different HMS
Collimator cuts settings in order to study the stability of the
yield ratio.  

The collimator has horizontal/vertical dimension fixed. A cut on
these dimentions is considered a scale 1. These dimensions are then
modified by multipliying horizontal/vertical dimensions by the same 
scale factor.


The Cuts applied are:
__________________________
HMS Delta  : -8, 8
SHMS Delta : -10, 22
W          : 0.85, 1.05

The collimator cut values studied are:

HMS scale factor:
---------------
no collimator cut

0.95
0.9
0.85
0.8
0.75
