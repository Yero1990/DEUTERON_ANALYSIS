***********************
Coincidence Time Study
***********************

The SIMC/DATA comparisons, and Pm yield ratios are investigated.

The general cuts applied:
Em < 40 MeV
HMS Delta: (-8, 8)
SHMS Delta: (-10, 22)
HMS Collimator Cut

Study the cuts:
* Coin Time Cut: (>11,<15) and its Anti-Cut
* Study the ztarget_difference (h_ztar-e_ztar) 
  	-> look at SHMS focal plane with an anti-cut on zTar_difference
	   to see where they come from.
