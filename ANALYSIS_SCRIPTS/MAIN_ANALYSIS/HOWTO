====How to Run Analysis to get Average Cross Sections=====
==========================================================

The relevant input files and codes are:
* set_deep_cuts.inp      (input file)
* main_analysis.C        (steering code)
* analyze.C / analyze.h  (source code)

Step1: Check input file settings are:
       RUN_SIMC: 1
       RUN_DATA: 1  (DATA will be done first by the steering code as it is needed for later rad.  corrections.)
       radiate: -1
       rad_corr_flag: 1  (SIMC will read the radiative file first. Then if rad_corr_flag:1, then
                           it will do a second pass of the anlysis by reading non-radiative file.
			   and calculate/apply rad corr. to data)

	**NOTE** : The code currently applies FSI radiative correction to the data, so it assumes
	           the FSI radiative ratio ROOTfile exists. This means FSI model must run before 
		   PWIA model. An alternative is to apply raditavie corrections using their
		   respective models. This way, one can quantify the effect of the different
		   radiative corr. models on the cross section, and get a systematic for that.
	
		   
       Kinematic Setting Flags: 
       The kinematic settings are chosen depending on which cross section you want.

       Setting Cuts: The cuts are set to their nominal values. For systematic studies,
       once can change them to see how the cross section changes.
