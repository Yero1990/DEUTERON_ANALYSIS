Extracting Average Kinematics 
from 2D Pmiss vs. theta_nq
*******************************

To extract the average kinematics:

** run the code calc_avg_kin.py

This code reads a ROOTfile with the existing 2D Pmiss vs. theta_nq
histograms averaged over the kinematic variables, Ein, kf, theta_p, 
theta_e, etc.

In essence, the code used the python module bin_info2.py to extract
the relevant information from the 2D histo.  
This module uses the method: get_histo_data(histo), which
loops over the x and y range of the 2D histo bins (nested loop)
and extracts the bin content (representing the averaged quantity on
that specific (Pm, th_nq) bin), and it error.
